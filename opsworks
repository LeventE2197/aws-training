OPSWORKS

- Configuration management platform.
- Provides more control over infrastructure design and management than Elasticbeanstalk.
- Infrastructure as a code using Chef recipes for fine grained control.
- Consist of a CM model based upon stacks, layers and recipes.


STACK

- Top-level Opworks entity.
- Represents a set of instances and applications that you want to manage collectively.

LAYERS

- Defines how to set up and configure instances and resources.
- Stacks must contains one or more layers.
- Layers must contain at least one instance.
- Instances can be a member of multiple layers.
- Apps represent code to run on your server.

SCALING

- 24/7 instances added to a layer can manually start, stop or reboot the corresponding EC2 instances.
- Automatic Scaling could be:
	- Time based instances. Based upon a schedule.
	- Load based instances. Based upon several load metrics (Network Trafic , CPU Utilization) 

>> The combination of all 3 types is an effective strategy.

DEPLOYMENT

- App and associated infrastructure is deployed automatically.
- Chef recipes define infrastructure as a code.
	- Customisation.
	- Redeployment.
	- Version control.
	- Code reuse.
