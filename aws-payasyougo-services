AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 100 cloud services. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. 

You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.
