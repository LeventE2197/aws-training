EC2 - ELASTIC CLOUD COMPUTE

- EC2 INSTANCE TYPE
	- General Purpose.
	- Compute Optimized.
	- Memory Optimized.
	- GPU.
	- Storage Optimized.

- T2 Burstable Performance Instances
	- Baseline performance and ability to burst are governed by CPU credits.
	- Credits are built up and store for up to 24hrs. instance is operating bellow the baseline performance.
	- Credits are used to burst above baseline capacity when needed.
	- If your instance does not maintain a positive CPU credit balance for bursting consider upgrading to larger instance.

- EC2 STORAGE OPTIONS
	- Instance Store
		- Physically attached to the host server.
		- Data Not Lost when OS is rebooted.
		- Data Lost when:
			- Underlying drive fails.
			- Instance is stopped.
			- Instance is terminated.
		>> Do not rely on fo valuable long term data. 
		>> Cannot detach and attach to another instance.

	- ELASTIC BLOCK STORE (EBS)
		- Replicated within AZ.
		- EBS optimized instances provide dedicated throughput between EC2 and EBS volume.
		- EBS volumes attached at instance launch are deleted when instance is terminated.
		- EBS volumes attached to a running instance are not deleted when instance is terminated but are detached with data intact.

- EBS STORAGE OPTIONS
	- General Purpose (SSD)
		- Default choice.

	- Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
		- Consistent and low-latency performance.
		- I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases.

	- Magenic
		- Lower cost per Gigabyte.

	- EBS Encryption
		- AWS Key Management Service (KMS) master keys or Customer Master Key (CMK).
		- Data stored at rest encrypted (including snapshots created) as well as data in transit between EBS and EC2.
