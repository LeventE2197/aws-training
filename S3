Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service.

- Also known as object storage.

- Amazon S3 is a highly durable and distributed data store. Using a web services interface, you can store and retrieve large amounts of data as objects in buckets.

- In Amazon S3 data is stored as objects.
	- Objects can be any file type.
	- Objects are assigned an object key.
	- The object key linked to each object is unique.
	- Metadata can also be stored with each object.

- Syncronously stored on multiple devices.

- The name of S3 bucket must be globally unique.

- A bucket is created in private by default.

- The content owner can always access the content of the bucket created.

- The bucket has the following componets:
	- Versioning.
	- Loggin.
	- Tags.


BUCKET

- Container for objects stored in S3.
- Total volume of data and number of objects are unlimited.
- Bucket name must:
	- Be unique.
	- Be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
	- Be lowercase.
	- Must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.

OBJECT

- Entities (data/metadata) stored in a bucket.
- 0 bytes to a max of 5 TB.
- Largest object upload is 5 GB.
- Multi-part upload for 100 MB to 5 TB.


LIFECYCLE POLICIES

- Obect deletion after expiry time.
- Object archiving to Glacier after expiry time.
- Can be restored from Glacier back to S3.


S3 VERSIONING

- Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of the same object in the same bucket.
- Preserves copies of objects inside a bucket.
- Preserve, retrieve, or restore every version of every object.
- Individual objects can be restored to previous versions.
- Deleted objects can be recovered.
- Is enabled at the bucket level.
- Is disabled by default.
- Can be disabled, but not deleted.
- Overriding an object result in a new object being created, with a new version number attached.
- Versioning operation are managed by AWS.
- Create lifeclycle policied to control dataflow.
	- Archival and expiration dates.
	- Integrated with AWS Glacier.


SECURITY

- S3 is secure by default. The bucket is private when created.
- IAM roles, users and groups.
- Bucket policies applied at the bucket level.
- Access Control List (ACL) applied at the bucket and object level.
- Permissions can be set in several ways:
	- On each object.
	- On each bucket.
	- IAM policy or bucket policy.

S3 SECURITY FEATURES

- Access Logging.
- Event Notifications.
- CloudTrail Audit.
- CORS Configuration.

- CloudWatch S3 Metrics.

DURABILITY

- 99.999999999 - 11 9's durability.

AVAILABILITY

- 99.99 - 4 9's Availability.

S3 STORAGE CLASS

- Standard.
	- 99.999999999% durability (Multi-AZ).
	- 99.99% Availability.
	- Support SSL encryption in transit and at rest.
	- Lifecycle management.

	- 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability.
	- Being deprecated by AWS.


- Manage and securely control access to S3 objects.
	- Classify your data type rather than location.
	- Tag objects with key-value pairs.
	- Create policies based on data type.


[S3 DATA PROTECTION]

- Client-side Encryption.

- Server-side Encryption.
	- Encryption is performed at the object level.
	- Data is encypted during the writting to disk.
	- Data is decrypted during the reading process.
	- SSE encrypts the object data but not the associated metadata.
		- Unencrypted metadata could be a compliance issue.

- Use customer provided keys.

- AWS provided Encryption keys (VAULT).

- Protecting data in transit.
	- Use ssl endpoints over HTTPS.
	- Secure upload and download of data.
	- Client side encryption before upload.

- Protecting data in rest.
	- AWS does the encryption and decryption process.
	- Key management is encrypted by AWS S3 master Key.
	- Key management is stored separately from your data.
	- AWS 256-bit Encryption.
	- Integrated with AWS KMS.
